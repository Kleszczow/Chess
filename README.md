<h1>Chess Game</h1>

This project was about learning how to move html elements by using the mouse.
Issues that have caused problems so far have been used in the project:
appendChild()
setAttribute()
preventDefault()
stopPropagation()
The biggest section of the project, however, became the rules for moving pieces. contained in the conditional switch statement.
